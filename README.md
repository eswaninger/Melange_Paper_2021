# Melange_Paper_2021
To Do List
  1. Start Using Git [X]
  2. Look through and simplify the functions of scripts. Each script should be able to run all at once without individual cells. []
  3. Decide what figures I may need to tell story and which scripts are associated with them.
  - Glacier velocities (To show slow down of ice tooth), melange velocities (to show hardening of melange at the same time as slow down), torque moment at calving, shear strength of iceberg at calving.
  4. Atmospheric Noise Correction
  5. Add moment to Force balance
  6. Check OpenPIV parameters
  7. Main Takeaways to convey: 
   - summer melange provides resistance to iceberg capsize.
   - shear strength estimates for ice material failure at calving is lower than prior estimates.
   - calving can act as a set of dominos in which one calving event tears at the ice behind it, which can make trigger more frequent calving.
   - icebergs that are torn away from the glacier as opposed to just broken off may be under appreciated because models consider slab capsize calving in 2D and disregard lateral processes.
